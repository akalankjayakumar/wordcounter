# wordcounter
This project is a simple word counter, created with Python. It can read a file and output the most frequently used words, or ask the user what words to count. This project uses knowledge I gained in Udacity's Intro to CS and University of Michigan's "Python for Everbody" courses.

An extension of this project is linked [here](https://github.com/akalankjayakumar/WhatsApp-Chat-Analysis), where I scrape data from a WhatsApp Chat export (a .txt file) to generate insights such as the most frequent texter, frequently used words, messages sent by hour of the day, by date etc. An explanatory blog post with visualizations can be found here: https://www.notion.so/127dd325ba844bedb3c494ce4ed053a7.
